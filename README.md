# Personal Bio Generator 👤

A JavaScript project that demonstrates string manipulation, template literals, and data formatting by creating personalized bio cards for multiple people.

## 📋 Project Description

This project generates formatted profile cards for three individuals, showcasing their personal information including name, age, hometown, hobbies, and fun facts. It demonstrates fundamental JavaScript string operations through practical application.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was built to practice and demonstrate:
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Template literals for string interpolation
- String `.length` property
- Bracket notation for character access
- `indexOf()` method for substring searching
- Console output formatting

## 🚀 Features

- **Multiple Profiles**: Creates bio cards for 3 different people
- **String Analysis**: Calculates name lengths and analyzes character positions
- **Secret Code Generator**: Creates unique code names using first and last letter combinations
- **Keyword Search**: Searches for specific words in hobbies using `indexOf()`
- **Formatted Output**: Professional-looking console display with clear sections

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-bio-generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd personal-bio-generator
```

3. Run the JavaScript file:
```bash
node index.js
```

Or open `index.html` in a browser and check the console (F12).

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Template Literals
- String Methods

## 📝 Code Sections

The code is organized into 6 clear steps:

1. **Setup Person Information** - Variable declarations
2. **Create Bio Sentences** - Template literal usage
3. **Use Length Property** - String length calculations
4. **Use Bracket Notation** - Character access
5. **Use indexOf()** - Substring searching
6. **Formatted Profile Card** - Professional output display

## 🎓 What I Learned

- How to use template literals for dynamic string creation
- The difference between `.length` (property) and `[.length]` (undefined)
- How bracket notation accesses characters at specific positions
- How `indexOf()` returns -1 when a substring isn't found
- The importance of planning with pseudocode before coding
